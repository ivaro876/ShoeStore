# ShoeStore I'm creating an online store for Mr. Johnson. He is currently the owner of a shoe distribution store that houses multiple brands
This mini project should implement a database that can make him easily keep track of his customers, inventory, orders, accounts payable 
and accounts owed to customers and merchants.
